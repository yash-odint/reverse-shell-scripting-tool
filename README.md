# Reverse Shell Python Socket Programming Project

This is a Python-based project that demonstrates the implementation of a reverse shell using socket programming. The project allows a user to remotely control a target machine using a command shell.
## How it Works

The project consists of two scripts: client.py and server.py.

The server.py script must be run on the attacker machine while the client.py script is executed on the victim/target machine. Once the client.py script is executed on the target machine, it establishes a connection with the server.py script running on the attacker machine.

The attacker can then remotely execute shell commands on the victim/target machine using the server.py script. These commands are executed on the client.py script running on the target machine, and the output is sent back to the attacker through the established connection.
